This work uses two files from different authors. popup.el and vhdl-goto-def.el is not written by me. This work enhances vhdl-goto-def and adds the capability to track defitions in other libraries.
- I do not guarantee correct usage in all the files. The VHDL parser written for the project is very basic.

- Copy the popup.el, vhdl-goto-def.el and vhdl-extreme.el files to the load-path.
- Add these lines to your config file.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (require 'popup)
  (require 'vhdl-goto-def)
  (require 'vhdl-extreme)
#+END_SRC


* Usage

- Add a file named .extreme to the top level directory of the source files.
This file is used to define the VHDL library paths.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
lib-name : lib-absolute-path
#+END_SRC

- Call the (goForTheWordUnderPoint) function in order to go to the definition of word under the cursor.
- Call the (searchForTheWordUnderPoint) function in order to show the definition of word under the cursor in a popup window.
  
- The gif file shows the usage on VHDL files from another git repository (https://github.com/sergeykhbr/riscv_vhdl)
